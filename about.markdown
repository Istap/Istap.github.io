A total noob trying to learn reverse engineering. This blog exists because
* I hope that having a blog helps me motivate myself
* it forces me to recap what I have learned, which hopefully makes me remember it better
* it may help someone else (lol)
* it gives me a nice excuse to toy around with hakyll
