<p>Sadly progress has once again been slow in the past two weeks due to a lot of private responsibilities. While I did finish chapter 10, I only did so yesterday, a whole week after I originally wanted to be finished. Furthermore, I didn’t have time for even a single MBE challenge.</p>
<p>On the upside, I figured out how to run the sample programs for the book on x64 by myself, which basically meant I had to get rid of the pushad/popad instructions present in the code. It’s not that great of an achievement (look which registers get modified in the method, push them on entering and pop them on exiting) I am a bit proud that I managed to do it by myself. I am also quite certain that I found an off-by-one error in one of the samples which hasn’t been covered by the errata yet, I may send the author an email.</p>
<p>For next week, my plan is to finish chapter 11. This shouldn’t be a problem, seeing as it is a lot shorter than chapter 10. Additionally, I want to finish the first three MBE challenges.</p>
<p>Let’s hope this week goes better than the last one.</p>
