<p>Last week sadly wasn’t very productive as I had a lot of personal business to attend to but I solemnly swear to make up for it this week (or next week, since I will be on holidays).</p>
<p>Notably, this week was the first time that I was exposed to gdb. Up until now, I had always used Eclipse for my C debugging needs and although I had also toyed with the idea of learning gdb when starting with this blog, I ultimately settled on radare. However it seems as if the documentation for gdb is a lot better or at the very least a lot more accessible for beginners, which is why I will also use gdb. I will still try to learn radare2, but I might prefer gdb for now. If you have never used gdb before, I found this excellent <a href="https://reverseengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/1935/how-to-handle-stripped-binaries-with-gdb-no-source-no-symbols-and-gdb-only-sho">post</a> which made it easy to start. As for radare2, I created a bare-bones cheat sheet for using gdb:</p>
<pre><code>    gdb = start gdb
    file &lt;file&gt; = load file
    info file = show symbols, segments, entry point etc.
    set args &lt;arg1&gt; &lt;arg2&gt; = set arguments to use for run
    show args = show arguments
    run &lt; &lt;input&gt; &gt; &lt;output&gt; = let the program run with a specified input and output
    break * &lt;address&gt; = break at address
    break * &lt;address&gt; if $&lt;register&gt; == &lt;value&gt; = break at address if register has specified value
    watch $&lt;register&gt; == &lt;value&gt; = break when register has specified value
    set disassembly-flavor intel = set disassembly flavor
    layout asm = show assembly instructions
    layout regs = show register state
    step = take a &quot;big&quot; step
    stepi = step a single assembly instruction
    &lt;Enter&gt; = repeat previous command</code></pre>
<p>On a side note, I have realized that the goals I laid down in my previous post were actually pretty terrible: I need to set myself a specific goal, which allow me to supervise my progress. For this week my goals are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Complete the MBE preliminary crackmes</li>
<li>I am currently halfway through chapter 9 of “Assembly Language Step by Step”. By next week I want to be finished with chapter 9 and chapter 10.</li>
</ul>
<p>Another side note: I have started reading “Understanding the Linux Kernel”. Since I am riding the train quite often, it is nice to have some reading material. “Assembly Language” sadly doesn’t really qualify, since it requires me to program, which I don’t really want to do on the train.requires me to program, which I don’t really want to do on the train.</p>
