<h1 id="radare-2">Radare 2</h1>
<p>Using radare2 for the first time reminded me of my first time with vim: utter confusion. In fact, radare2 and vim handle similarily: both have a ton of one letter commands which can be combined with numbers, other commands, pattern matching information… Once you get the hang of it, it is a very powerful way of using a program, but getting into it is tough. Since the two are so similar in their usage, I have adapted the way I learned vim: learn the absolute minimum of commands needed to accomplish something and continue from there. Right now I mostly use the following commands in this exact order:</p>
<pre><code>    aaa = analyze all
V = switch to visual mode
p = cycle through the views
:db x = set breakpoint at x (usually main)
:dc = continue execution until breakpoint
s = single step
c = change to cursor mode
; = add comment</code></pre>
<p>I have mostly played around with the first intro crackme of the <a href="security.cs.rpi.edu/courses/binexp-spring2015">Modern Binary Exploitation</a> course. The crackme itself wasn’t a challenge (password is a hardcoded string) but it was a nice way of getting familiar with radare.</p>
<h1 id="x86-assembly">x86 Assembly</h1>
<p>I also started reading a book on x86 assembly, thereby breaking my own rule of not reading too many books at once (but at least I finished “Expert C programming” this week). The first book I tried was “Assembly Language For x86 Processors”, however since I am limiting myself to using Linux for now I put it aside for the time being and started reading “Assembly Language Step by Step”. So far I am quite satisfied, the first few chapters were a bit of a drag as I was familiar with most of the material, but it is easy to follow his lectures about the actual programming, which is nice.</p>
<p>So far the material was rather basic, it dealt with how to properly assemble and link your code using nasm and ld, executing a system call and some basic assembly operations such as mov. The author used a debugger called Insight and a hex editor whose name I can’t recall right now, I used radare2 for both tasks.</p>
<h1 id="goals">Goals</h1>
<p>My goals for next week are to finish as many of the MBE crackmes as I can and read a few chapters of the book.</p>
