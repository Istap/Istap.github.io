Hello to whoever is reading this. I set up this blog to document my journy of learning reverse engineering. As of right now, I am a complete beginner with a background in computer science, so this blog will probably be quite uninteresting for anyone with even modest experience (except if you want to correct or help me, for which I would be quite thankful). Occasionally I may write about topics that don't deal with reverse engineering - such as .NET or music -, but the main reason for this blog is to force myself to actually make some progress.

My current goal is to finish the "Microcorruption" CTF within a year without reading any sort of guide directly related to the game. I have already successfully completed the first few levels, but I think the later levels will require me to learn a lot.

I have come up with a "plan" on what to learn:

- It is essential that I can use tools needed to analyze binaries. This involves learning how to efficiently use small programs such as "strings", as well as applications which are more complex. Although I realize that IDA is the go-to tool of reverse engineering, I don't have enough money for a license and will start out with radare2.
- There is a lot of theory that I have to learn: I will start out with the content offered at beginners.re and the book "Practical Reverse Engineering". History has taught me that I will lose focus if I read too many books at the same time, so I will try to keep the count of in-progress books as low as possible. 
- By putting the material which I learn into practice, I can test if I actually understood what I learned. Additionally it won't be as easy for me to forget what I learned if I apply it. For those reasons, I will try to regularily solve some crackmes and share the writeup here.

I will try to write at least one post per week, if I have enough time and material I might write more.

How do you actually end a blog post?
